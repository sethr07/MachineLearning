Machine Learning models used to train the MNIST data set.

Classifers used: 
1. Random Forrest
2. XG Boost
3. Ada Boost
4. SVM rbf kernel
5. SVM linear
6. Decision Tree

The accuracies and time taken to train the models are calculated and plotted. 

AutoML is used on the dataset well. Results are stored in csv.
